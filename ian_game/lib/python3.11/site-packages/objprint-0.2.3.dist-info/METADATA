           TERMS AND CONDITIONS FOR USE, REPRODUCTION, AND DISTRIBUTION
        
           1. Definitions.
        
              "License" shall mean the terms and conditions for use, reproduction,
              and distribution as defined by Sections 1 through 9 of this document.
        
              "Licensor" shall mean the copyright owner or entity authorized by
              the copyright owner that is granting the License.
        
              "Legal Entity" shall mean the union of the acting entity and all
              other entities that control, are controlled by, or are under common
              control with that entity. For the purposes of this definition,
              "control" means (i) the power, direct or indirect, to cause the
              direction or management of such entity, whether by contract or
              otherwise, or (ii) ownership of fifty percent (50%) or more of the
              outstanding shares, or (iii) beneficial ownership of such entity.
        
              "You" (or "Your") shall mean an individual or Legal Entity
              exercising permissions granted by this License.
        
              "Source" form shall mean the preferred form for making modifications,
              including but not limited to software source code, documentation
              source, and configuration files.
        
              "Object" form shall mean any form resulting from mechanical
              transformation or translation of a Source form, including but
              not limited to compiled object code, generated documentation,
              and conversions to other media types.
        
              "Work" shall mean the work of authorship, whether in Source or
              Object form, made available under the License, as indicated by a
              copyright notice that is included in or attached to the work
              (an example is provided in the Appendix below).
        
              "Derivative Works" shall mean any work, whether in Source or Object
              form, that is based on (or derived from) the Work and for which the
              editorial revisions, annotations, elaborations, or other modifications
              represent, as a whole, an original work of authorship. For the purposes
              of this License, Derivative Works shall not include works that remain
              separable from, or merely link (or bind by name) to the interfaces of,
              the Work and Derivative Works thereof.
        
              "Contribution" shall mean any work of authorship, including
              the original version of the Work and any modifications or additions
              to that Work or Derivative Works thereof, that is intentionally
              submitted to Licensor for inclusion in the Work by the copyright owner
              or by an individual or Legal Entity authorized to submit on behalf of
              the copyright owner. For the purposes of this definition, "submitted"
              means any form of electronic, verbal, or written communication sent
              to the Licensor or its representatives, including but not limited to
              communication on electronic mailing lists, source code control systems,
              and issue tracking systems that are managed by, or on behalf of, the
              Licensor for the purpose of discussing and improving the Work, but
              excluding communication that is conspicuously marked or otherwise
              designated in writing by the copyright owner as "Not a Contribution."
        
              "Contributor" shall mean Licensor and any individual or Legal Entity
              on behalf of whom a Contribution has been received by Licensor and
              subsequently incorporated within the Work.
        
           2. Grant of Copyright License. Subject to the terms and conditions of
              this License, each Contributor hereby grants to You a perpetual,
              worldwide, non-exclusive, no-charge, royalty-free, irrevocable
              copyright license to reproduce, prepare Derivative Works of,
              publicly display, publicly perform, sublicense, and distribute the
              Work and such Derivative Works in Source or Object form.
        
           3. Grant of Patent License. Subject to the terms and conditions of
              this License, each Contributor hereby grants to You a perpetual,
              worldwide, non-exclusive, no-charge, royalty-free, irrevocable
              (except as stated in this section) patent license to make, have made,
              use, offer to sell, sell, import, and otherwise transfer the Work,
              where such license applies only to those patent claims licensable
              by such Contributor that are necessarily infringed by their
              Contribution(s) alone or by combination of their Contribution(s)
              with the Work to which such Contribution(s) was submitted. If You
              institute patent litigation against any entity (including a
              cross-claim or counterclaim in a lawsuit) alleging that the Work
              or a Contribution incorporated within the Work constitutes direct
              or contributory patent infringement, then any patent licenses
              granted to You under this License for that Work shall terminate
              as of the date such litigation is filed.
        
           4. Redistribution. You may reproduce and distribute copies of the
              Work or Derivative Works thereof in any medium, with or without
              modifications, and in Source or Object form, provided that You
              meet the following conditions:
        
              (a) You must give any other recipients of the Work or
                  Derivative Works a copy of this License; and
        
              (b) You must cause any modified files to carry prominent notices
                  stating that You changed the files; and
        
              (c) You must retain, in the Source form of any Derivative Works
                  that You distribute, all copyright, patent, trademark, and
                  attribution notices from the Source form of the Work,
                  excluding those notices that do not pertain to any part of
                  the Derivative Works; and
        
              (d) If the Work includes a "NOTICE" text file as part of its
                  distribution, then any Derivative Works that You distribute must
                  include a readable copy of the attribution notices contained
                  within such NOTICE file, excluding those notices that do not
                  pertain to any part of the Derivative Works, in at least one
                  of the following places: within a NOTICE text file distributed
                  as part of the Derivative Works; within the Source form or
                  documentation, if provided along with the Derivative Works; or,
                  within a display generated by the Derivative Works, if and
                  wherever such third-party notices normally appear. The contents
                  of the NOTICE file are for informational purposes only and
                  do not modify the License. You may add Your own attribution
                  notices within Derivative Works that You distribute, alongside
                  or as an addendum to the NOTICE text from the Work, provided
                  that such additional attribution notices cannot be construed
                  as modifying the License.
        
              You may add Your own copyright statement to Your modifications and
              may provide additional or different license terms and conditions
              for use, reproduction, or distribution of Your modifications, or
              for any such Derivative Works as a whole, provided Your use,
              reproduction, and distribution of the Work otherwise complies with
              the conditions stated in this License.
        
           5. Submission of Contributions. Unless You explicitly state otherwise,
              any Contribution intentionally submitted for inclusion in the Work
              by You to the Licensor shall be under the terms and conditions of
              this License, without any additional terms or conditions.
              Notwithstanding the above, nothing herein shall supersede or modify
              the terms of any separate license agreement you may have executed
              with Licensor regarding such Contributions.
        
           6. Trademarks. This License does not grant permission to use the trade
              names, trademarks, service marks, or product names of the Licensor,
              except as required for reasonable and customary use in describing the
              origin of the Work and reproducing the content of the NOTICE file.
        
           7. Disclaimer of Warranty. Unless required by applicable law or
              agreed to in writing, Licensor provides the Work (and each
              Contributor provides its Contributions) on an "AS IS" BASIS,
              WITHOUT WARRANTIES OR CONDITIONS OF ANY KIND, either express or
              implied, including, without limitation, any warranties or conditions
              of TITLE, NON-INFRINGEMENT, MERCHANTABILITY, or FITNESS FOR A
              PARTICULAR PURPOSE. You are solely responsible for determining the
              appropriateness of using or redistributing the Work and assume any
              risks associated with Your exercise of permissions under this License.
        
           8. Limitation of Liability. In no event and under no legal theory,
              whether in tort (including negligence), contract, or otherwise,
              unless required by applicable law (such as deliberate and grossly
              negligent acts) or agreed to in writing, shall any Contributor be
              liable to You for damages, including any direct, indirect, special,
              incidental, or consequential damages of any character arising as a
              result of this License or out of the use or inability to use the
              Work (including but not limited to damages for loss of goodwill,
              work stoppage, computer failure or malfunction, or any and all
              other commercial damages or losses), even if such Contributor
              has been advised of the possibility of such damages.
        
           9. Accepting Warranty or Additional Liability. While redistributing
              the Work or Derivative Works thereof, You may choose to offer,
              and charge a fee for, acceptance of support, warranty, indemnity,
              or other liability obligations and/or rights consistent with this
              License. However, in accepting such obligations, You may act only
              on Your own behalf and on Your sole responsibility, not on behalf
              of any other Contributor, and only if You agree to indemnify,
              defend, and hold each Contributor harmless for any liability
              incurred by, or claims asserted against, such Contributor by reason
              of your accepting any such warranty or additional liability.

A library that can print Python objects in human readable format

## Install
```
pip install objprint
```

## Usage

### op

Use ```op()``` (or ```objprint()```) to print objects.

```python
from objprint import op

class Position:
    def __init__(self, x, y):
        self.x = x
        self.y = y

class Player:
    def __init__(self):
        self.name = "Alice"
        self.age = 18
        self.items = ["axe", "armor"]
        self.coins = {"gold": 1, "silver": 33, "bronze": 57}
        self.position = Position(3, 5)

op(Player())
```

```
<Player 0x7fe44e1e3070
  .age = 18,
  .coins = {'bronze': 57, 'gold': 1, 'silver': 33},
  .items = ['axe', 'armor'],
  .name = 'Alice',
  .position = <Position
    .x = 3,
    .y = 5
  >
>
```

You can print multiple objects just like print, except ``op`` will print them in separate lines

```python
op([1, 2], {'a': 1})
```

```
[1, 2]
{'a': 1}
```

``op`` will return the same object it prints, so you can do something like this

```python
a = MyObject()
# print the args inline with minumum change
function_using_object(op(a))
# the difference is more significant with complex expressions
# original: function_using_object(a.f() + a.g())
function_using_object(op(a.f() + a.g()))
```

It works on multiple objects as well, as it returns a tuple, you need to unpack it for functions

```python
a = MyObject()
function_using_object(*op(a.f(), a.g()))
```

### add_objprint

If you want to use ```print()``` to print your object, you can also use the class decorator
```add_objprint``` to add ```__str__``` method for your class.

```python
from objprint import add_objprint

class Position:
    def __init__(self, x, y):
        self.x = x
        self.y = y

@add_objprint
class Player:
    def __init__(self):
        self.name = "Alice"
        self.age = 18
        self.items = ["axe", "armor"]
        self.coins = {"gold": 1, "silver": 33, "bronze": 57}
        self.position = Position(3, 5)

# This will print the same thing as above
print(Player())
```

### objstr

If you want the ``str`` representation of the object, instead of printing it on the screen,
you can use ``objstr`` function

```python
from objprint import objstr

s = objstr(my_object)
```

### print more

There are some optional information you can print with [config](###config).

#### "Public" Methods

There are no REAL public methods in python, here I simply meant you can print methods that do not start with ``__`` as there will be
a lot of default magic methods and you don't want that.

```python
class Player:
    def attack(self, opponent):
        pass

op(Player(), print_methods=True)
```

```
<Player 0x7fe44e1e3070
  def attack(opponent)
>
```

As you can see, it will also print the method signature(without ``self`` argument).

#### Line numbers

You can print execution info, including the function it's in, the file and the line number of the printing line.
This is helpful for you to locate where this object is printed.

```python
def f():
    op(Player(), line_number=True)
f()
```

```
f (my_script.py:29)
<Player 0x7f30e8cb1ac0
  ...
>
```

### Argument names

You can print the expression of the argument with `arg_name`

```python
op(Player(), arg_name=True)
```

```
Player():
<Player 0x7f495850a8d0
  ...
>
```

### objjson

``objprint`` supports print objects to json to make it easier to serialize an object.

``objjson`` returns a jsonifiable object that can be dumped with ``json.dumps``

```python
from objprint import objjson

json_obj = objjson(Player())

print(json.dumps(json_obj, indent=2))
```

```
{
  ".type": "Player",
  "name": "Alice",
  "age": 18,
  "items": [
    "axe",
    "armor"
  ],
  "coins": {
    "gold": 1,
    "silver": 33,
    "bronze": 57
  },
  "position": {
    ".type": "Position",
    "x": 3,
    "y": 5
  }
}
```

You can use ``op`` to print in json format directly with ``format="json"``. You can pass in argument for ```json.dumps```

```python
op(Player(), format="json", indent=2)
```

``add_objprint`` also works with ``format="json``"

```python
@add_objprint(format="json", indent=2)
class Player:
    pass
```

### Enable/Disable the print

You can disable prints from all the ``op()`` calls globally with ``enable`` config.

```python
from objprint import op

op.disable()
op([1, 2, 3])  # This won't print anything
op.enable()  # This could fix it!
```

Or you can use it for ``op()`` functions individually with some conditions

```python
op(obj, enable=check_do_print())
```

### attribute selection

You can customize which attribute to print with name filters.

``objprint`` will try to match the attribute name with ``attr_pattern`` regex. The default
``attr_pattern`` is ``r"(!_).*"``, which means anything that does NOT start with an `_`.

You can customize ``attr_pattern`` to select the attributes you want to print:

```python
# This will print all the attributes that do not start with __
op(Player(), attr_pattern=r"(!__).*")
```

You can also use ``include`` and ``exclude`` to specify attributes to print with regular expression
so ```objprint``` will only print out the attributes you are interested in.

```python
op(Player(), include=["name"])
```
```
<Player
  .name = 'Alice'
>
```

```python
op(Player(), exclude=[".*s"])
```

```
<Player 0x7fe44e1e3070
  .name = 'Alice',
  .age = 18,
  .position = <Position
    .x = 3,
    .y = 5
  >
>
```

If you specify both ``include`` and ``exclude``, it will do a inclusive check first, then filter out the attributes
that match exclusive check.

```attr_pattern```, ```include``` and ```exclude``` arguments work on ```objprint```, ```objstr``` and ```@add_objprint```.

### Register Custom Type Formatter

You can also customize how certain types of objects are displayed by registering a custom formatter function to transform an object of a specific type into a string. 

For example, you can print all integers in hexadecimal format by registering the ```hex()``` function for the ```int``` data type, or registering a custom ```lambda``` function. 

```python
from objprint import op

op.register_formatter(int, hex)
op.register_formatter(float, lambda x: f"{round(x, 3)}")
op(10)  # prints 0xa
op(3.14159)  # prints 3.142
```

Alternatively, you can also register a custom formatter function using a decorator:

```python
@op.register_formatter(str)
def custom_formatter(obj: str):
    return f"custom_print: {obj}"

op("hi")  # prints custom_print: hi
```

During registration, ```objprint``` will examine the specified object type, and raise a ```TypeError``` if an invalid object type is provided.

When you finish using the custom formatters, you can unregister them with ```unregister_formatter()```.

```python
op.unregister_formatter(int, float, str)
op(10)  # prints 10
op(3.14159)  # prints 3.14159
op("hi")  # prints hi
```

Or you can unregister everything by passing no argument to it.

```python
op.unregister_formatter()
```

The ```register_formatter()``` function also accepts an ```inherit``` argument (default ```True```) to dictate if the registered formatter should also apply to any derived classes of the object type.

```python
class BaseClass:
    name = 'A'

class DerivedClass(BaseClass):
    name = 'B'
```

With ```inherit=True```, derived class will share the same formatter registered under base class. 

```python
def base_formatter(obj: BaseClass) -> str:
    return f'Print {obj.name} with Base Class Formatter'

op.register_formatter(BaseClass, base_formatter, inherit=True)

op(DerivedClass())
```

```
Print B with Base Class Formatter
```

With ```inherit=False```, derived class will use the default formatter provided by ```objprint```. 

```python
@op.register_formatter(BaseClass, inherit=False)
def base_formatter(obj: BaseClass) -> str:
    return f'Print {obj.name} with Base Class Formatter'

op(DerivedClass())
```

```
<DerivedClass 0x7fb42e8216a0
  .name = 'B'

If a derived class inherits from multiple base classes, each with a registered formatter, the chosen formatter adheres to the Method Resolution Order (MRO) of the derived class.

To check all the registered functions and their inheritance status, you can use the ```get_formatter()``` method. It returns a dictionary-like object that you can print for easy inspection.

```python
fmts = op.get_formatter()
print(fmts)
```

```
{<class '__main__.BaseClass'>: FormatterInfo(formatter=<function base_formatter at 0x7feaf33d1f70>, inherit=False)}
```

Please note that registering a formatter function with ```op``` will affect the output of ```objprint``` and ```objstr``` methods in the same way.

### config

```objprint``` formats the output based on some configs

* ``config_name(default_value)`` - this config's explanation
* ``enable(True)`` - whether to print, it's like a switch
* ``depth(100)`` - how deep ```objprint``` goes into nested data structures
* ``indent(2)`` - the indentation
* ``width(80)`` - the maximum width a data structure will be presented as a single line
* ``elements(-1)`` - the maximum number of elements that will be displayed, ``-1`` means no restriction
* ``color(True)`` - whether to use colored scheme
* ``line_number(False)`` - whether to print the ``function (filename:line_number)`` before printing the object
* ``arg_name(False)`` - whether to print the argument expression before the argument value
* ``skip_recursion(True)`` - whether skip printing recursive data, which would cause infinite recursion without ``depth`` constraint
* ``honor_existing(True)`` - whether to use the existing user defined ``__repr__`` or ``__str__`` method
* ``attr_pattern(r"(!_).*")`` - the regex pattern for attribute selection
* ``include([])`` - the list of attribute regex to do an inclusive filter
* ``exclude([])`` - the list of attribute regex to do an exclusive filter

You can set the configs globally using ``config`` function

```python
from objprint import config
config(indent=4)
```

Or if you don't want to mess up your name space

```python
from objprint import op
op.config(indent=4)
```

Or you can do a one time config by passing the arguments into ``objprint`` function

```python
from objprint import op

op(var, indent=4)
```

### install

Maybe you don't want to import ``op`` in every single file that you want to use. You can
use ``install`` to make it globally accessible

```python
from objprint import op, install

# Now you can use op() in any file
install()

# This is the same
op.install()

# You can specify a name for objprint()
install("my_print")
my_print(my_object)
```
